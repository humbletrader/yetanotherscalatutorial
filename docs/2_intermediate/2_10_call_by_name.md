# Call by name

Example of "call by name" vs. call by value for parameters
```scala mdoc
  
  val assertsEnabled = false

  //condition is a "by value parameter"
  def myAssertByValue(condition: Boolean) = {
    println("inside assertion by value")
    if (assertsEnabled && !condition) throw new AssertionError
  }

  //condition is a "by name" parameter
  def myAssertByName(condition: => Boolean) = {
    println("inside assertion by name")
    if (assertsEnabled && !condition) throw new AssertionError
  }

  def myAssertWithFunc(condition: () => Boolean) = {
    println("inside assertion with function")
    if (assertsEnabled && !condition()) throw new AssertionError
  }

  lazy val fiveIsGreaterThan3: Boolean = {
    println("evaluating condition 5 > 3")
    5 > 3
  }

  lazy val tenIsGreaterThan3: Boolean = {
    println("evaluating condition 10 > 3")
    10 > 3
  }


  //here the condition is evaluated and the value
  //is sent to the myAssert function
  //The evaluation is done only once (before the method call)
  //in case the assertions are disabled (see assertsEnabled value above)
  //the condition is still evaluated
  myAssertByValue(fiveIsGreaterThan3)

  //the condition is evaluated only when used
  //this means it can be evaluated multiple times or never
  myAssertByName(tenIsGreaterThan3) //in this case (assertsEnabled = false) the condition is never evaluated

  //this is the same as "by name" only that is uglier to use
  myAssertWithFunc(()=> 20 > 3)

  //just for fun
  //we pass a function application to myAssert methods
  myAssertByValue(
      (
        () => {
          println("evaluating 30 > 3")
          30 > 3
        }
        )() //this is the application of a function (with no parameters
    )

  myAssertByName((() => {
      println("evaluating 31 > 3")
      31 > 3
  })())
```
