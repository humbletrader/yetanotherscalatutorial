# Value classes

 * value classes are not stored in the heap
 * they offer better performance as compared to the reference types however there are limitations
 * everything about value classes can be found [here](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/value-classes.html)

A value class can wrap a value type

```scala mdoc 
class Currency(val amount: Float) extends AnyVal {
  def prettyPrint : String = s"$amount dollars"
}
```
But it can also wrap a non value (i.e a reference) type

```scala mdoc
class PhoneNumber(val s: String) extends AnyVal {
  def digits : String = s.replaceAll("""\D""", "")
}
```

Because the JVM does not support value classes, Scala sometimes needs to actually instantiate a value class
A value class is actually instantiated when :
    1. a value class is treated as another type.
    2. a value class is assigned to an array.
    3. doing runtime type tests, such as pattern matching.
